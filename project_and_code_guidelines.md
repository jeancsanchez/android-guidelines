## 1.0 File naming

### 1.0 Class files
Class names are written in [UpperCamelCase](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CamelCase).

For classes that extend an Android component, the name of the class should end with the name of the component; for example: `SignInActivity`, `SignInFragment`, `ImageUploaderService`, `ChangePasswordDialog`.

### 2.0 Resources files

Resources file names are written in __lowercase_underscore__.

#### 2.1 Drawable files

Naming conventions for drawables:


| Asset Type   | Prefix            |		Example               |
|--------------| ------------------|-----------------------------|
| Action bar   | `ab_`             | `ab_stacked.9.png`          |
| Button       | `btn_`	            | `btn_send_pressed.9.png`    |
| Dialog       | `dialog_`         | `dialog_top.9.png`          |
| Divider      | `divider_`        | `divider_horizontal.9.png`  |
| Icon         | `ic_`	            | `ic_star.png`               |
| Menu         | `menu_	`           | `menu_submenu_bg.9.png`     |
| Notification | `notification_`	| `notification_bg.9.png`     |
| Tabs         | `tab_`            | `tab_pressed.9.png`         |

Naming conventions for icons (taken from [Android iconography guidelines](http://developer.android.com/design/style/iconography.html)):

| Asset Type                      | Prefix             | Example                      |
| --------------------------------| ----------------   | ---------------------------- |
| Icons                           | `ic_`              | `ic_star.png`                |
| Launcher icons                  | `ic_launcher`      | `ic_launcher_calendar.png`   |
| Menu icons and Action Bar icons | `ic_menu`          | `ic_menu_archive.png`        |
| Status bar icons                | `ic_stat_notify`   | `ic_stat_notify_msg.png`     |
| Tab icons                       | `ic_tab`           | `ic_tab_recent.png`          |
| Dialog icons                    | `ic_dialog`        | `ic_dialog_info.png`         |

Naming conventions for selector states:

| State	       | Suffix          | Example                     |
|--------------|-----------------|-----------------------------|
| Normal       | `_normal`       | `btn_order_normal.9.png`    |
| Pressed      | `_pressed`      | `btn_order_pressed.9.png`   |
| Focused      | `_focused`      | `btn_order_focused.9.png`   |
| Disabled     | `_disabled`     | `btn_order_disabled.9.png`  |
| Selected     | `_selected`     | `btn_order_selected.9.png`  |


#### 2.1.1 Layout files

Layout files should match the name of the Android components that they are intended for but moving the top level component name to the beginning. For example, if we are creating a layout for the `SignInActivity`, the name of the layout file should be `activity_sign_in.xml`.

| Component        | Class Name             | Layout Name                   |
| ---------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Activity         | `UserProfileActivity`  | `activity_user_profile.xml`   |
| Fragment         | `SignUpFragment`       | `fragment_sign_up.xml`        |
| Dialog           | `ChangePasswordDialog` | `dialog_change_password.xml`  |
| AdapterView item | ---                    | `item_person.xml`             |
| Partial layout   | ---                    | `partial_stats_bar.xml`       |

A slightly different case is when we are creating a layout that is going to be inflated by an `Adapter`, e.g to populate a `ListView`. In this case, the name of the layout should start with `item_`.

Note that there are cases where these rules will not be possible to apply. For example, when creating layout files that are intended to be part of other layouts. In this case you should use the prefix `partial_`.

#### 2.1.2 Menu files

Similar to layout files, menu files should match the name of the component. For example, if we are defining a menu file that is going to be used in the `UserActivity`, then the name of the file should be `activity_user.xml`

A good practice is to not include the word `menu` as part of the name because these files are already located in the `menu` directory.

#### 2.1.3 Values files

Resource files in the values folder should be __plural__, e.g. `strings.xml`, `styles.xml`, `colors.xml`, `dimens.xml`, `attrs.xml`


### 2.1.4 Arguments in Fragments and Activities

When data is passed into an `Activity `or `Fragment` via an `Intent` or a `Bundle`, the keys for the different values __must__ follow the rules described in the section above.

When an `Activity` or `Fragment` expects arguments, it should provide a `public static` method that facilitates the creation of the relevant `Intent` or `Fragment`.

In the case of Activities the method is usually called `getStartIntent()`:

```java
public static Intent getStartIntent(Context context, User user) {
	Intent intent = new Intent(context, ThisActivity.class);
	intent.putParcelableExtra(EXTRA_USER, user);
	return intent;
}
```

For Fragments it is named `newInstance()` and handles the creation of the Fragment with the right arguments:

```java
public static UserFragment newInstance(User user) {
	UserFragment fragment = new UserFragment;
	Bundle args = new Bundle();
	args.putParcelable(ARGUMENT_USER, user);
	fragment.setArguments(args)
	return fragment;
}
```

__Note 1__: These methods should go at the top of the class before `onCreate()`.

__Note 2__: If we provide the methods described above, the keys for extras and arguments should be `private` because there is not need for them to be exposed outside the class.

## 2.2 XML style rules

### 2.2.1 Use self closing tags

When an XML element doesn't have any contents, you __must__ use self closing tags.

This is good:

```xml
<TextView
	android:id="@+id/text_view_profile"
	android:layout_width="wrap_content"
	android:layout_height="wrap_content" />
```

This is __bad__ :

```xml
<!-- Don\'t do this! -->
<TextView
    android:id="@+id/text_view_profile"
    android:layout_width="wrap_content"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content" >
</TextView>
```


### 2.2.2 Resources naming

Resource IDs and names are written in __lowercase_underscore__.

#### 2.2.3 ID naming

IDs should be prefixed with the name of the element in lowercase underscore followed by the view first name and an action name at the end. For example:


| Element            | View            | Action          | ResultView       |
| -----------------  | ----------------- |---------------|----------------- |
| `TextView`         | `MainActivity`    | `App title`   |`textview_main_title`|
| `ImageView`        | `AccountFragment` | `User photo`  |`imageview_account_photo`|
| `Button`           | `LoginActivity`   | `Login with email`  |`button_login_email`|


#### 2.2.4 Strings

String names start with a prefix that identifies the section they belong to. For example `registration_email_hint` or `registration_name_hint`. If a string __doesn't belong__ to any section, then you should follow the rules below:


| Prefix             | Description                           |
| -----------------  | --------------------------------------|
| `error_`             | An error message                      |
| `msg_`               | A regular information message         |
| `title_`             | A title, i.e. a dialog title          |
| `action_`            | An action such as "Save" or "Create"  |



#### 2.2.5 Styles and Themes

Unless the rest of resources, style names are written in __UpperCamelCase__.


## 3.0 Tests style rules

### 3.0.1 Unit tests

Test classes should match the name of the class the tests are targeting, followed by `Test`. For example, if we create a test class that contains tests for the `DatabaseHelper`, we should name it `DatabaseHelperTest`.

Test methods are annotated with `@Test` and should generally start with the name of the method that is being tested, followed by a precondition and/or expected behaviour.

* Template: `@Test void methodNamePreconditionExpectedBehaviour()`
* Example: `@Test void signInWithEmptyEmailFails()`

Precondition and/or expected behaviour may not always be required if the test is clear enough without them.

Sometimes a class may contain a large amount of methods, that at the same time require several tests for each method. In this case, it's recommendable to split up the test class into multiple ones. For example, if the `DataManager` contains a lot of methods we may want to divide it into `DataManagerSignInTest`, `DataManagerLoadUsersTest`, etc. Generally you will be able to see what tests belong together because they have common [test fixtures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_fixture).

### 3.0.2 Espresso tests

Every Espresso test class usually targets an Activity, therefore the name should match the name of the targeted Activity followed by `Test`, e.g. `SignInActivityTest`

When using the Espresso API it is a common practice to place chained methods in new lines.

```java
onView(withId(R.id.view))
        .perform(scrollTo())
        .check(matches(isDisplayed()))
```
